<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>This SRFI defines the trivial type <i>timespec</i>, which is used
to represent the <code>struct timespec</code> defined by the
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/time.h.html">
P<small>OSIX</small> <code>&lt;time.h&gt;</code> header</a>.</p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>The reason for putting this very simple and straightforward type
into a SRFI (and library) of its own is that timespecs are part of the
interface for more than one SRFI.  If they are defined in just
one SRFI and imported by the rest, that produces an otherwise useless
and unnecessary dependency on the SRFI containing the definition.
This arises particularly
in R6RS and R7RS because record types are generative (distinct
definitions lead to distinct record types) and because most implementations
report a warning or even an error if the same identifier is imported from
more than one library, unless they have both imported it in turn
from the same original library.</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<p>Timespec is an immutable type that holds two exact integer values:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <i>seconds</i> component &mdash; If non-negative, the number of whole
seconds since a particular
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(computing)">epoch</a>.
If negative, the number of whole seconds to go back in time from the epoch.
Normally excludes leap seconds (i.e. a leap second that occurs between the
epoch and <i>seconds</i> does not increment or decrement <i>seconds</i>).
The minimum range of values is 2<sup>-39</sup> (inclusive)
to 2<sup>39</sup> (exclusive), allowing a range of at least 15,000 years
before and after the epoch.</p></li>
<li><p>The <i>nanoseconds</i> component &mdash; The partial second added to
<i>seconds</i>. Always non-negative and less than 10<sup>9</sup>.
If <i>seconds</i> is non-negative, this is the number of additional
nanoseconds to go toward the future after <i>seconds</i>.
If <i>seconds</i> is negative, this is the number of additional nanoseconds
to go further back in time before <i>seconds</i>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is recommended, but not absolutely required, that timespecs
be a disjoint and immutable type.  For efficiency's sake they may be represented
otherwise in particular implementations.  If they are not disjoint, the
exact representation (such as a SRFI 19 time object
or a pair) must be documented by the implementation.</p>

<p>If timespecs are represented as SRFI 19 time objects,
the <code>timespec</code> constructor must set the
SRFI 19 time type to <code>TIME_UTC</code>.
It is an error to mutate a time object (or pair, or other type)
that is serving as a timespec,
and if this is done, code relying on the immutability of timespecs will break.</p>

<p>Note that IEEE 64-bit floats are <i>not</i> a sufficient representation
for timespecs,
<p>It is recommended, but not required, that timespecs
be a disjoint type, but for efficiency's sake they may be represented
otherwise in particular implementations.
It is an error to mutate the values held in a timespec object.
Note that IEEE 64-bit floats are <i>not</i> a sufficient representation,
because their nanosecond-precision range is confined to a period of 208 days
centered on the epoch.</p>
<p>In no case can this SRFI guarantee anything about the accuracy of
timespecs, or the precision of any timespec sources. Since it is difficult
to usefully determine and communicate timestamp precision and accuracy
in most applications, the timespec type does not contain any standard
field to hold such information.</p>

<h2>Documentation requirements</h2>

<p>An implementation of this SRFI must document:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which concrete representation is used for the timespec abstract
data type (a disjoint type, a pair, etc.)</li>
<li>The minimum and maximum values of the <i>seconds</i>
component.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Procedures</h2>

<p><code>(timespec </code><i>seconds nanoseconds</i><code>)</code></p>

<p>Returns a timespec with the given <i>seconds</i>
and <i>nanoseconds</i> components.</p>

<p><code>(timespec? </code><i>obj</i><code>)</code></p>

<p>Returns <code>#f</code> if <i>obj</i> is definitely not a timespec,
and <code>#t</code> if it is most probably one.</p>

<p>If timespecs are a disjoint type, this procedure simply tests whether
<i>obj</i> belongs to that type.  If not, then each component
is checked to see if it is an exact integer, and in the case
of the <i>nanoseconds</i> component, whether it is a non-negative integer
less than 10<sup>9</sup>.
In addition, if the implementation knows that its fixnum width is at least 40 bits,
it can also check that the value of the seconds component is a fixnum.</p>

<p><code>(timespec-seconds </code><i>timespec</i><code>)</code></p>

<p>Returns the <i>seconds</i> component of <i>timespec</i>.
The result must be the same (in the sense of <code>eqv?</code>)
as the value passed to <code>timespec</code>.</p>

<p><code>(timespec-nanoseconds </code><i>timespec</i><code>)</code></p>

<p>Returns the <i>nanoseconds</i> component of <i>timespec</i>.
The result must be the same (in the sense of <code>eqv?</code>)
as the value passed to <code>timespec</code>.</p>

<p><code>(inexact->timespec </code><i>inexact</i><code>)</code></p>

<p>Converts <i>inexact</i> into an approximate number of seconds and
nanoseconds since the (unspecified) epoch and returns the results as
a timespec object.</p>

<p><code>(timespec->inexact </code><i>timespec</i><code>)</code></p>

<p>Returns an inexact number representing the seconds from the epoch to
the value of <i>timespec</i>.</p>

<p>Note that these operations are not inverses, because inexact numbers
typically do not have nanosecond precision.</p>

<p><code>(timespec=? </code><i>timespec1 timespec2</i><code>)</code></p>

<p>Returns <code>#t</code> if <i>timespec1</i> and <i>timespec2</i>
represent the same instant of time, and <code>#f</code> otherwise.

<p><code>(timespec&lt;? </code><i>timespec1 timespec2</i><code>)</code></p>

<p>Returns <code>#t</code> if <i>timespec1</i> represents an earlier
instant of time than <i>timespec2</i>, and <code>#f</code> otherwise.

<p>Note that it is an (undetectable) error to compare two
timespecs that are relative to different epochs.</p>

<p><code>(timespec-hash </code><i>timespec</i><code>)</code></p>

<p>Returns an exact non-negative integer representing a hash code
for <i>timespec</i>.</p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>An implementation of SRFI 174 is in the repository of this SRFI.
The files are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>srfi/174.sld</code> - uses a disjoint type</li>
<li><code>chibi-tests.scm</code> - Tests using <code>(chibi tests)</code></li>
<li><code>chibi-tests-pair.scm</code> - Tests for <code>(srfi pair-174)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: A pair-based implementation is also available; simply
comment out the `define-record-type` declaration
in <code>srfi/174.sld</code> and remove the comment markers
from the declarations that follow.
</p>

<p>Discussions between me, Lassi Kortela, and Harold Ancell, mostly on the
<a href="https://srfi-email.schemers.org/srfi-170/">SRFI 170
mailing list</a>, made the need for this SRFI clear.</p>
