<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>This SRFI defines the trivial type <i>timespec</i>, which is used
to represent the <code>struct timespec</code> defined by the
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/time.h.html">
P<small>OSIX</small> <code>&lt;time.h&gt;</code> header</a>.</p>

<h1>Issues</h1>

None at present.

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>The reason for putting this very simple and straightforward type
into a SRFI (and library) of its own is that timespecs are part of the
interface for more than one SRFI.  If they are defined in just
one SRFI and imported by the rest, that produces an otherwise useless
and unnecessary dependency on the SRFI containing the definition.
This arises particularly
in R6RS and R7RS because record types are generative (distinct
definitions lead to distinct record types) and because most implementations
report a warning or even an error if the same identifier is imported from
more than one library, unless they have both imported it in turn
from the same original library.</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<p>Timespec is a immutable type that holds two exact integer values:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <i>seconds</i> component &mdash; If non-negative, the number of whole
seconds since a particular
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(computing)">epoch</a>.
If negative, the number of whole seconds to go back in time from the epoch.
Normally excludes leap seconds (i.e. a leap second that occurs between the
epoch and <i>seconds</i> does not increment or decrement <i>seconds</i>).
The minimum range of values is 2<sup>-39</sup> (inclusive)
to 2<sup>39</sup> (exclusive), allowing a range of at least 15,000 years
before and after the epoch.</p></li>
<li><p>The <i>nanoseconds</i> component &mdash; The partial second added to
<i>seconds</i>. Always non-negative and less than 10<sup>9</sup>.
If <i>seconds</i> is non-negative, this is the number of additional
nanoseconds to go toward the future after <i>seconds</i>.
If <i>seconds</i> is negative, this is the number of additional nanoseconds
to go further back in time beyond <i>seconds</i>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is recommended, but not required, that timespecs
be a disjoint type, but for efficiency's sake they may be represented
otherwise in particular implementations.  If they are not disjoint, the
exact representation (such as a pair) must be documented
by the implementation.
It is an error to mutate the values held in a timespec object.
Note that IEEE 64-bit floats are <i>not</i> a sufficient representation,
because their nanosecond-precision range is confined to a period of 208 days
centered on the epoch.</p>
<p>In no case can this SRFI guarantee anything about the accuracy of
timespecs, or the precision of any timespec sources. Since it is difficult
to usefully determine and communicate timestamp precision and accuracy
in most applications, the timespec type does not contain any standard
field to hold such information.</p>

<h2>Procedures</h2>

<p><code>(timespec </code><i>seconds nanoseconds</i><code>)</code></p>

<p>Returns a timespec with the given <i>seconds</i>
and <i>nanoseconds</i> components.</p>

<p><code>(timespec? </code><i>obj</i><code>)</code></p>

<p>Returns <code>#f</code> if <i>obj</i> is definitely not a timespec,
and <code>#t</code> if it is most probably one.</p>

<p>If timespecs are a disjoint type, this procedure simply tests whether
<i>obj</i> belongs to that type.  If not, then each component
is checked to see if it is an exact integer, and in the case
of the <i>nanoseconds</i> component, whether it is a non-negative integer
less than 10<sup>9</sup>.
In addition, if the implementation knows that its fixnum width is at least 40 bits,
it can also check that the value of the seconds component is a fixnum.</p>

<p><code>(timespec-seconds </code><i>timespec</i>)</code></p>

<p>Returns the <i>seconds</i> component of <i>timespec</i>.
The result must be the same (in the sense of <code>eqv?</code>)
as the value passed to <code>timespec</code>.</p>

<p><code>(timespec-nanoseconds </code><i>timespec</i>)</code></p>

<p>Returns the <i>nanoseconds</i> component of <i>timespec</i>.
The result must be the same (in the sense of <code>eqv?</code>)
as the value passed to <code>timespec</code>.</p>

<p><code>timespec-comparator</code></p>

<p>This variable (not a procedure) is a comparator object for
timespecs, ordering them by the total number of nanoseconds.
A simple hash function is also provided.</p>

<p>Note that it is an (undetectable) error to compare two
timespecs that are relative to different epochs.</p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>Two implementations of SRFI 174 are in the repository of this SRFI.
The files are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>srfi/174.sld</code> - uses a disjoint type</li>
<li><code>srfi/pair-174.sld</code> - uses a pair</li>
<li><code>chibi-tests.scm</code> - Tests using <code>(chibi tests)</code></li>
<li><code>chibi-tests-pair.scm</code> - Tests for <code>(srfi pair-174)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Discussions between me, Lassi Kortela, and Harold Ancell, mostly on the
<a href="https://srfi-email.schemers.org/srfi-170/">SRFI 170
mailing list</a>, made the need for this SRFI clear.</p>
